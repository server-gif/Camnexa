/**
 * Google Ad Manager GPT (Google Publisher Tags) loader and helpers.
 *
 * The whole module is a thin, defensive wrapper over the one global `googletag`
 * object the GPT script (`gpt.js`) installs. It is the only place that touches
 * `window.googletag`, so the React side stays declarative.
 *
 * Everything short-circuits when `gamEnabled` is false: no script is injected
 * and `showInterstitial` / `showRewarded` resolve immediately, so a caller can
 * always `await` them before navigating without ever being blocked when ads are
 * off (which is how the test suite runs). Failures inside the ad stack are
 * swallowed on purpose — an ad error must never strand the user on a page.
 *
 * The rewarded placement uses GPT's *out-of-page* REWARDED format, but only on
 * mobile-shaped viewports — Google wraps the overlay in an un-styleable white
 * backdrop on desktop, so wide screens fall back to the dark interstitial
 * modal below. The anchor placement is the Google-*managed* out-of-page
 * BOTTOM_ANCHOR format — the exact call from GPT's "Display an anchor ad"
 * sample (developers.google.com/publisher-tag/samples/display-anchor-ad): the
 * two-step strip pinned to the bottom edge, with the ⌄ tab that expands the
 * card and the ⌃ tab that minimises it. Google renders and owns that overlay;
 * we only mount, rotate and tear it down per route, and never on the home
 * screen (see `AdAnchor`). (The format is picked via `anchorFormat`, which
 * prefers `BOTTOM_ANCHOR` and falls back to `TOP_ANCHOR` / `ANCHOR` so the
 * placement can never go silently dead.) The interstitial instead uses
 * an ordinary *in-page* slot that lives inside a custom blurred full-screen
 * modal (`.inter` in globals.css), mirroring the reference site: the modal is
 * kept in the DOM permanently and pre-filled, and `showInterstitial` reveals it
 * on every Continue click. Navigation is held until the user taps Close (or
 * presses Escape), then the slot is re-requested so the next click is ready —
 * and when two interstitial tags are configured, that refill re-defines the
 * slot on the *other* tag (odd/even rotation, see `nextAdUnit`).
